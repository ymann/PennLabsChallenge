# PennLabsChallenge
Welcome! This is my submission for the PennLabs challenge. Below are setup instructions.

## Setup
First, you must install all the project dependencies. Navigate to the PennLabsChallenge directory and run "npm install" from the terminal.
Next, start the database server locally by running "mongod --dbpath ./data/db".
Finally, run "npm start" to bring the local server. the server listens at port 3000, so make sure that the port is free. 

## Test Page
Once the server is up and running, you can test out the site by navigating to "http://localhost:3000/get-data".

That's it. Enjoy!
